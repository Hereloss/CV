## What have I done (but also been paid for)?

**Michael Bailey Associates** (05/2021 to 11/2021) - Delivery Consultant (Recruiter)

- During this role, I sourced candidates for positions and jobs, listening and making suggestions as I went.  
- I also helped train up two new staff members on both the software and other responsibilities of the role.  
- My primary duties were to call candidates, update the database and coordinate interviews and start dates of the candidates.  
- During my time there, nearly 20 candidates were offered roles successfully found roles and started the contracts due to my work.  

**Quilter** (02/2020 to 04/2021) - Customer Service Administrator

- During this role, I worked with lots of data and ensured this was input quickly and accurately onto the system.  
- I also helped with mentoring other staff members and helped out other teams when required.  
- Due to this, we got through a system migration of the data on time and target, with a minimal amount of disruption.  

**Tutorful** (09/2018 to 11/2019) - Personal Tutor

- In this freelance role, I took on clients and, on my own, created and taught the required materials, including making worksheets and ensuring the lessons were taught clearly and concisely.  
- Due to this, the students consistently improved their grades and had much better results come the end of the year.  

**Cricketer's Arms (Greene King)** (07/2016 to 09/2018) - Bartender/Waiter

- In this role, I worked both behind the bar and serving tables, working alongside colleagues in stressful situations and ensuring the orders were made correctly and the bar ran smoothly.  
- This allowed us to run the pub efficiently and have good reviews over the busy summer months.  

## What am I good at?

One of my most vital skills is that I am logically minded and can find solutions to complex problems easily. I've demonstrated this many times, including during my degree, during which I did several projects, including a Chaos Theory project, as well as within my past roles, where I've found better and more effective solutions. During my past roles, I had many chances to show this, including my role at Quilter, where I had to employ my logic skills regarding the data sets and ensure the correct information and details were inputted and stored. I also showed this in my previous job as a recruiter, where I had to come to logical conclusions regarding the roles and who they would be suitable for.  

Another strong skill of mine is teamwork and collaborative working. Makers has helped me to hone and demonstrate this skill, as almost all of my coding during Makers was either paired or part of a team, working in multiple technologies and many different situations in this manner. The 3 Team projects allowed me to put this on full display, and for all the projects, we worked well as a team and had excellent outcomes and enjoyed the projects, especially for the Gem Junkies and Wormz final projects.   


#### What else am I good at?
I also have additional skills in both creativity and using both this and my logical skills to contribute to and complete complex and impressive projects. For example, my creative skills have helped me with numerous non-coding projects during my studies and in many previous roles, including my Mars Society project (which has been published in a book), and within my last position, where I could come up with novel solutions to problems and therefore achieve better and more consistent outcomes within the roles.  

## Where did I learn this?

#### Makers Academy November 2021 - Feburary 2022
- During my time at Makers, I worked on several projects. In the beginning, I did many pair projects with other students in Ruby and Rspec, learning how Databases, Web development and just general TDD, OOP and MVC programming worked. We then did a group project, MakersBNB, which brought all of these skills together and let me experience Agile working in a team.    
  
- After this, we worked in Javascript with testing in Jest, making more web-based programs and using my previous experience to learn a new language quickly, efficiently, and well. We then moved on to our next larger group project, Acebook (which we renamed Gem Junkies). We used Rails and had a much longer project time, allowing us to properly plan and fully execute a large, complex project with many difficult database relations.  
   
- Finally, we did a final project in Makers, for which I worked with a team to recreate the game Worms (which we called Wormz) using Javascript, Matter.js, P5, Jest, Mocha and Chai over two weeks. We initially started working in React Native; however, we realised this was not the right stack for our game and so instead changed to just pure JS. We also used the Spike and Stabilise methodology rather than TDD for this project, as this fit best with the nature of the game and timescale. We carried out a lot of manual testing as well and finished by presenting this project to our peers.  

#### What did I learn at University / College (between 09/2015 to 07/2020)?

##### Mathematics (With a Year Abroad), King's College London (Year abroad in UCSB) - 2:1
- During this time, I also did a project on Chaos Theory, studied in California for a year, and helped run several societies, including Ice Skating (Social Secretary) and the Rock and Metal Society (Treasurer). I was also a member of multiple other societies, including the Swimming Team and the Cocktail society.  

#### What else can I do?

I have a project published for the Mars Society in their newest book, Mars City States (New Societies for a New World). I also have several music qualifications, including Grade 7 Piano and Grade 5 Guitar. Further, I also studied other subjects at a university level during my year abroad, including Astronomy, Electromagnetism and Chaos Theory.  

## What do I do that's not work?

I like to code stuff in my spare time - I've previously worked on a Ruby Chess application, playable on the Ruby Terminal (In my GitHub under "Terminal Chess"). Since Graduating, I've been working on a project using the Unity Game Engine called "Grandparadox". After that, I plan to work on a Mobile app called Cocktail Roulette, a Jackbox party style game called Cocktail Poker and a collaborative music-creation app.  

## But what do I like to do that's not work OR coding?

I play several instruments, including Piano, Guitar and Double Bass, enjoy travelling, exploring new cities, and long walks. I also love to go out and experience lots of new things, such as new food places, new experiences just in general or anything cool that's around, really!
