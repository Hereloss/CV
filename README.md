## What am I good at?

One of my strongest skills is that I am logically minded and can find solutions to complex problems easily. I've demonstrated this many times, including during my degree, during which I did a number of projects including a Chaos Theory project, as well as within my past roles, where I've found better and more effective solutions. During my past roles, I had many chances to show this including my role at Quilter, where I had to employ my logic skills with regards to the data sets and ensuring the correct information and details were inputted and stored, and in my previous job as a recruiter, where I had to come to logical conclusions with regards to the roles and who they would be suitable for.

Another strong skill of mine is in teamwork and collaborative working. Makers has really helped me to hone and demonstrate this skill, as almost all of my coding during Makers was either paired or part of a team, working in multiple technologies and in many different situations in this manner. The 3 Team projects really allowed me to put this on full display, and for all the projects we worked well as a team and had great outcomes and enjoyed the projects, especially for the Gem Junkies project and the Wormz final project.   


#### What else am I good at?
I also have further skills in both creativity and using both this and my logical skills to contribute to and complete complex and impressive projects. 
My creative skills have helped me with numerous non-coding projects during my studies and in many previous roles, including my Mars Society project (which has been published in a book) and wthin my last role, where I could come up with novel solutions to problems and therefore acheive better and more consitent outcomes within the roles.

## Where did I learn this?

#### Makers Academy November 2021 - Feburary 2022
- During my time at Makers, I worked on a number of projects. At the beginning, I did many pair projects with other students in Ruby and Rspec, learning how Databases, Web development and just general TDD, OOP and MVC programming worked. We then did a group project, MakersBNB which brought all of these skills together and let me experience Agile working in a team.  
  
- After this, we moved on to working in Javascript and testing in Jest, making more web-based programs and using my previous experience to learn a new language quickly, efficently but well. We then moved onto our next larger group project, Acebook (which we renamed Gem Junkies), for which we used Rails and had a much longer project time, allowing us to properly plan and fully execute a large, complex project with many difficult database relations.  
   
- Finally, we did a final project in Makers, for which I worked with a team to recreate the game Worms (which we called Wormz) using Javascript, Matter.js, P5, Jest, Mocha and Chai over a two week period. We initialy started working in React Native, however realised this was not the right stack for our game and so instead changed to just pure JS. We also used the Spike and Stabalise methodology rather than TDD for this project, as with the nature of the game and timescale this fit best. We also carried out a lot of manual testing as well, and finished by presenting this project to our peers.  

#### What did I learn at University / College (between 09/2015 to 07/2020)?

- Mathematics (With a Year Abroad), King's College London (Year abroad in UCSB)
- 2:1
- During this time, I did a project on Chaos Theory, studied in California for a year and also helped run a number of societies, including Ice Skating (Social Secretary) and the Rock and Metal Society (Treasurer)

#### What else can I do?

I have a project published for the Mars Society in their newest book, Mars City States (New Societies for a New World). I also have a number of music qualifications including Grade 7 Piano and Grade 5 Guitar. Further to this, I also studied other subjects at a university level during my year abroad, including Astronomy, Electromagnetism and Chaos Theory.

## What do I do that's not work?

I like to code stuff in my spare time - I've previously worked on a Ruby Chess application, playable on the Ruby Termainl (In my GitHub under "Terminal Chess"). Since Graduating, I've been working on a project using the Unity Game Engine called "Grandparadox", and have plans to work on a Mobile app called Cocktail Roulette, a Jackbox party style game called Cocktail Poker and collaborative music-creation app.

## But what do I like to do that's not work OR coding?

I play a number of instruments, including Piano, Guitar and Double Bass, enjoy traveling, exploring new cities and also long walks. I also love to go out and experience lots of new things, such as new food places, new experiences just in general or anything cool that's around really!
